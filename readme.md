# Ohayo Application

Its my third android application, after installation when clicked on start button we can see something awesome.

Main motive of this application was to implement SetTimeInterval of JS into my application by creating my own class of SetTimeInterval.

I can't provide apk now because apk is not signed and I don't know how to sign apk for now since its only been 1 week since I have started android developemnt.

So, please consider downloading code and generate apk and try it :]
